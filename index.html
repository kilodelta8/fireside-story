            <p>It was a dark and stormy night...
            When suddenly there was a flash of light and a blood curdling scream.
            Then Will Ferell emerged from the darkness in his Talladega Nights race suit.
            And as he ran to his race car, he screamed "Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jewish God! 
            Help me, Allah! Help me, Tom Cruise! Tom Cruise, use your witchcraft to get the 
            fire off me! Help me, Oprah Winfrey!"
            Thus began the premise of the story, well before the branches came.
